Coding conventions
==================

1. Naming everything

One should name functions and variables according to the following 
simple pattern.

1) Variables' names should be all lowercase, underscores and digits
are allowed (Matlab will prevent you from starting a variable name
from the underscore or a digit)

Good names:                         Bad names:

signal_model                        SignalModel, signalModel, SIGNAL_MODEL,
errors_by_params                    etc.
beta_index


2) Constants' names should be all uppercase with underscores:

Good names:                         Bad names:

MIN_BETA                            minBeta, min_beta, MinBeta
MC_ITERATIONS                       etc.

Note that names for variables and constants should be as descriptive 
as possible, e.g. 'noise_cov_matrix' not 'ncm' or 'sigma'.
There are no sigmas - there is a noise covariance matrix.


2) Functions' names should be named the same. Note that while function
name might not be as descriptive as a variable name, it should have 
a complete description of its meaning and operation in the source code. 
For example, the name might be 'fuzzyred', which is a little bit vague 
at the beginning, but the description should be such that a reader
should be able to understand most of the details concerning how it works.
Abbreviated names are allowed provided that their meaning is later 
determined.
